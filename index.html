          <h3>Who this guy?</h3>
          <p>My name is Àngel Castillo and I'm from, and currently live in, Barcelona. I've lived for two years in London and for a year in the Basque Country. Beautiful places. Very rainy.</p>
          <p>I'm a front-end web developer who likes developing front-end stuff for the web (hmmkay). I'm not married to any specific way of working nor technology, although sometimes I miss the simpler times of the old web, and with this website I tried to capture that: simple HTML and CSS with no JavaScript nor tracking codes of any kind. Also, a cool reto look to boot.</p>
          <h3>My hobbies</h3>
          <p>I like photography, hiking, watching movies (favourites: Blade Runner, Alien, Lost in Translation, Drive), reading, skating, and installing and testing old (and/or quirky) operating systems like Amiga, Macintosh (can you tell?), BeOS, Plan 9, MenuetOS, BSD, Minix, QNX and all sorts of Linux distros.</p>
          <p>I also like coding small, mostly useless apps challenging myself to do it in as little amount of lines of code as possible. Riveting, I know.</p>
          <h3>Technologies I use</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML5, CSS3, SASS, PostCSS</li>
            <li>JavaScript, React, Gatsby</li>
            <li>WordPress, Shopify, OctoberCMS, Jekyll</li>
            <li>... And others, including, but not limited to: Vagrant, Git, NPM, Gulp, Yarn, Twig, and several CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Bulma, Foundation, Tachyons, etc</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Despite all the above, I always prefer to code by hand and with as little tooling/building as possible.</p>
          <h3>Contact me</h3>
          <p class="mb-0">Let's be honest, the only way you can find this site is through the link in the signature of my email, so there's no point on adding it here.
          <br />It also means we've talked at least once, therefore I fully acknowledge and embrace the pointlessness of this website as a mean to reach new people.</p>
